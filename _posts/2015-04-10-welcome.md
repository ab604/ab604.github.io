title: Welcome to Alistair's GitHub Project Pages
---

This is a new site, so it's only got two pages - this one and the one where I scraped data from Google Scholar on Antigen Processing.

I'm not sure what else will be appearing here yet. It depends what I get up to. 

My official (and rather out of date) University page is over
at the [Computational Modelling Group](http://cmg.soton.ac.uk/people/ab604/) site. 

This site was built using [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com/), a two-column [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo)
